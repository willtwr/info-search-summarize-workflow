Based on the question, you will need to make one or more tool calls to look for answers. If none of the tool can be used, point it out and refuse to answer. If the given question lacks the parameters required by the tool, also point it out.

You have access to the following tools:
<tools>
{tools}
</tools>

For each tool call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
<tool_call>
[{"name": "func_name1", "arguments": {"argument1": "value1", "argument2": "value2"}}]
</tool_call>

Make sure that the function name matches at least one of the function_name in <tools></tools>.
