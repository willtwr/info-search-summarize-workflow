      "## Foreword\n",
      "\n",
      "'Budget 2025 represents the government's day in the sun, having navigated through the economic challenges of the past few years. These measures provide a strong foundation for economic resilience, support for families and streamlined tax administration.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaysia is currently buoyed by the recent strong economic growth, manageable inflation, and a robust Malaysian Ringgit against the US Dollar. Budget 2025 reflects the government's readiness to implement sustainable strategies to further fuel the economy while addressing the cost of living for the B40 and M40 groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Tax reliefs focusing on care\n",
      "\n",
      "## Expanding the revenue base\n",
      "\n",
      "Budget 2025 avoids major new taxes, while introducing measures to expand Malaysia's revenue base. The scope of the Sales and Service Tax (SST) will be broadened to include B2B commercial service transactions and non-essential food items. Additionally, a 2% tax on dividend income exceeding RM100,000 for individual shareholders will be introduced. A carbon tax targeting the steel and iron industry is proposed for 2026 to align with the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). These measures aim to create an equitable tax system, supporting long-term economic and environmental goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Empowering Malaysia's workforce\n",
      "\n",
      "We also see positive strides being made to incentivise businesses to foster a resilient, inclusive, and supportive workforce, aligning with broader socio-economic goals. The increase in minimum wage to RM1,700 with a six-month deferred implementation for small employers acknowledges economic realities while aiming to improve living standards. Additionally, mandatory Employees Provident Fund (EPF) contributions for non-citizen workers will extend social security more inclusively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tax deductions of up to 50% for hiring women returning to the workforce supports the move to increase female participation in the workplace, while initiatives to implement flexible work arrangements, and grant paid caregiver leave are steps in the right direction for workplace equality.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see a focus on supporting families through the proposed increase in tax relief for childcare and early education fees, along with higher relief for parents caring for disabled children. Proposals also aim to address long-term healthcare, education and financial well-being, by increasing relief for education and medical insurance, expanding medical expense relief, and extending relief for Private Retirement Scheme (PRS) contributions. The extension of the National Education Savings Scheme further encourages saving for higher education, promoting financial well-being and inclusivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Attracting foreign direct investments\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Global Minimum Tax being implemented in 2025, there is a pressing need to revamp Malaysia's incentive regime to attract high-value investments. Key proposals include streamlining existing incentives, introducing non-tax incentives, and exploring a Strategic Investment Tax Credit. Overall, we observed a number of measures to strengthen local supply chains, develop economic clusters, and emphasise economic spillover effects, all of which aim to bolster confidence in Malaysia's investment landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Budget 2025 is forward-thinking, leveraging positive economic sentiments to emphasise progressive tax measures, the well-being of the Rakyat, and workforce diversification. Clarity on certain measures, such as the expansion of SST, will be essential for smooth implementation and we hope that businesses will be given sufficient time to prepare for these changes.\n",

      "\n",
      "'Budget 2025 represents the government's day in the sun, having navigated through the economic challenges of the past few years. These measures provide a strong foundation for economic resilience, support for families and streamlined tax administration.'\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaysia is currently buoyed by the recent strong economic growth, manageable inflation, and a robust Malaysian Ringgit against the US Dollar. Budget 2025 reflects the government's readiness to implement sustainable strategies to further fuel the economy while addressing the cost of living for the B40 and M40 groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Tax reliefs focusing on care\n",
      "\n",
      "## Expanding the revenue base\n",
      "\n",
      "Budget 2025 avoids major new taxes, while introducing measures to expand Malaysia's revenue base. The scope of the Sales and Service Tax (SST) will be broadened to include B2B commercial service transactions and non-essential food items. Additionally, a 2% tax on dividend income exceeding RM100,000 for individual shareholders will be introduced. A carbon tax targeting the steel and iron industry is proposed for 2026 to align with the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). These measures aim to create an equitable tax system, supporting long-term economic and environmental goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Empowering Malaysia's workforce\n",
      "\n",
      "We also see positive strides being made to incentivise businesses to foster a resilient, inclusive, and supportive workforce, aligning with broader socio-economic goals. The increase in minimum wage to RM1,700 with a six-month deferred implementation for small employers acknowledges economic realities while aiming to improve living standards. Additionally, mandatory Employees Provident Fund (EPF) contributions for non-citizen workers will extend social security more inclusively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tax deductions of up to 50% for hiring women returning to the workforce supports the move to increase female participation in the workplace, while initiatives to implement flexible work arrangements, and grant paid caregiver leave are steps in the right direction for workplace equality.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see a focus on supporting families through the proposed increase in tax relief for childcare and early education fees, along with higher relief for parents caring for disabled children. Proposals also aim to address long-term healthcare, education and financial well-being, by increasing relief for education and medical insurance, expanding medical expense relief, and extending relief for Private Retirement Scheme (PRS) contributions. The extension of the National Education Savings Scheme further encourages saving for higher education, promoting financial well-being and inclusivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Attracting foreign direct investments\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Global Minimum Tax being implemented in 2025, there is a pressing need to revamp Malaysia's incentive regime to attract high-value investments. Key proposals include streamlining existing incentives, introducing non-tax incentives, and exploring a Strategic Investment Tax Credit. Overall, we observed a number of measures to strengthen local supply chains, develop economic clusters, and emphasise economic spillover effects, all of which aim to bolster confidence in Malaysia's investment landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Budget 2025 is forward-thinking, leveraging positive economic sentiments to emphasise progressive tax measures, the well-being of the Rakyat, and workforce diversification. Clarity on certain measures, such as the expansion of SST, will be essential for smooth implementation and we hope that businesses will be given sufficient time to prepare for these changes.\n",

      "Budget 2025 avoids major new taxes, while introducing measures to expand Malaysia's revenue base. The scope of the Sales and Service Tax (SST) will be broadened to include B2B commercial service transactions and non-essential food items. Additionally, a 2% tax on dividend income exceeding RM100,000 for individual shareholders will be introduced. A carbon tax targeting the steel and iron industry is proposed for 2026 to align with the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). These measures aim to create an equitable tax system, supporting long-term economic and environmental goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Empowering Malaysia's workforce\n",
      "\n",
      "We also see positive strides being made to incentivise businesses to foster a resilient, inclusive, and supportive workforce, aligning with broader socio-economic goals. The increase in minimum wage to RM1,700 with a six-month deferred implementation for small employers acknowledges economic realities while aiming to improve living standards. Additionally, mandatory Employees Provident Fund (EPF) contributions for non-citizen workers will extend social security more inclusively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tax deductions of up to 50% for hiring women returning to the workforce supports the move to increase female participation in the workplace, while initiatives to implement flexible work arrangements, and grant paid caregiver leave are steps in the right direction for workplace equality.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see a focus on supporting families through the proposed increase in tax relief for childcare and early education fees, along with higher relief for parents caring for disabled children. Proposals also aim to address long-term healthcare, education and financial well-being, by increasing relief for education and medical insurance, expanding medical expense relief, and extending relief for Private Retirement Scheme (PRS) contributions. The extension of the National Education Savings Scheme further encourages saving for higher education, promoting financial well-being and inclusivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Attracting foreign direct investments\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Global Minimum Tax being implemented in 2025, there is a pressing need to revamp Malaysia's incentive regime to attract high-value investments. Key proposals include streamlining existing incentives, introducing non-tax incentives, and exploring a Strategic Investment Tax Credit. Overall, we observed a number of measures to strengthen local supply chains, develop economic clusters, and emphasise economic spillover effects, all of which aim to bolster confidence in Malaysia's investment landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Budget 2025 is forward-thinking, leveraging positive economic sentiments to emphasise progressive tax measures, the well-being of the Rakyat, and workforce diversification. Clarity on certain measures, such as the expansion of SST, will be essential for smooth implementation and we hope that businesses will be given sufficient time to prepare for these changes.\n",
